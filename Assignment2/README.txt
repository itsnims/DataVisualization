These packages were used
-matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)
-numpy (pip install numpy)
--mpl_toolkits.basemap (installation instruction found here: http://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/installing.html)
--gdal (used by basemap, pip install GDAL) 
--pyproj (used by basemap, pip install pyproj)


the class data basically just the gives us the index 'record' of the given values by going into record and then calling packages.
The structure was done as I did in the assignment 1, with arrays and putting corresponding ones underneath each other.
The index function was provided by the site so i just took it from there.
The values are then just inserted in a grid.
the plotting and colouring of the whole thing was done with basemaps, the use was given/explained  there.
