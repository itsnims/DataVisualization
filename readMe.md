For the assignment I used Python 2.7.14 and did so in the Anaconda environment. 

For the creation of the charts, I decided to use plotly, which is needed to be installed as well as dash, dash_html_components, dash_core_components and dash_rendered, which all can be done over pip. For concrete instructions see https://plot.ly/dash/getting-started.

For execution, first install plotly as well as the needed libraries as mentionied above or explained in the link. Put all the files inside one folder and then execute Dashy.py in Anaconda. It will then generate a code under the given aderess(http:127.0.0.1:8050/). Open this in your desired browser.
