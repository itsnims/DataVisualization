# Birthrate in Zurich

In this assignment, we were given a csv file with information on number of births, gender, sex and in which district the children were born. In this exercise, we had to work with the data and create a dashboard with several different charts,
illustration different viewpoints of the data. Since the plot is interactive, I suggest, running the code in order to access the dynamic version

## Technical information
For the assignment I used Python 2.7.14 and did so in the Anaconda environment. 

For the creation of the charts, I decided to use plotly, which is needed to be installed as well as dash, dash_html_components, dash_core_components and dash_rendered, which all can be done over pip. For concrete instructions see https://plot.ly/dash/getting-started.

For execution, first install plotly as well as the needed libraries as mentionied above or explained in the link. Put all the files inside one folder and then execute Dashy.py in Anaconda. It will then generate a code under the given aderess(http:127.0.0.1:8050/). Open this in your desired browser.
